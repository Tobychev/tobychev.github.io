Also ran test with just black body, one shell and no actual source function in the integral, this gave good enough agreement that its important to do all the details properly. That is put the integral into physical units and make sure the MC and integral methods are compared on the same frequency grid.</p>

                  <li>
                      <b>June 28</b><p>Implemented fix to the unit test after @yeganer found the cause. Discussed with @wkerzendorf how to do the level absorption sum, and how atomic data is stored. The conclusion was that doing the sum in pandas can be done at the cost of a few hundred miliseconds.</p>

                  <li>
                      <b>June 30</b><p>Wrote a unit test for the attenuated source function. Considered the details of the final impact parameter integral. The simplest interpretation is that the way the intensities are derived "flattens" the problem so that the integration simply amounts to summing up the intensities according to whitin which shell a given impact parameter lies. This of course does not have any interpretation in the case of p less than R, so it's probably not correct. </p>
